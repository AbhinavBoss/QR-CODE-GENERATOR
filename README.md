HOW IT IS WORKING: 

This code creates a QR code instance using the qrcode.QRCode class and sets some properties such as the version, box size, and border.
It then adds the data to the QR code using the qr.add_data method and generates the QR code using the qr.make method.
Finally, it creates an image from the QR code using the qr.make_image method and saves it to a file named "qr.png".
